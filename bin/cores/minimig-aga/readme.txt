Minimig-AGA for MIST (BETA)
---------------------------

This is a beta release of Rok Krajnc's AGA extension of the Minimig
core with further enhancements by Alastair M. Robinson.

This is a work in progress and many things will still need fixing. 
Changes to get the CPU performance on par or beyond the A1200 have
caused some regressions. So a higher build number will not always
guarantee a more stable experience.

Recommended kickstart is Kickstart v3.1 rev 40.63 (A500-A600-A2000)

You'll need a firmware from 2015 to run these.

Optionally put the three files minimig.art, minimig.bal and
minimig.cop into the SD cards root directory for a nice boot
animation.
