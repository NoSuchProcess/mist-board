This is a fork of MiST firmware, to be merged with trunk one.
mmc.h/c :
* CRC16_buf : crc16 algorithm
* MMC_Init with CRC16 mode activated
* crc16 check on MMC_Read
user_io.h/c :
* while loop on user_io
spi.h/c :
* spi_block_write with 514 of data instead of 512 (512+crc16)

Gain robustness in dsk changes.

Tested with menu preference save and file written via CoreAmstrad (dump.dmp)

#Known bug #################################################################
From Eric Forgeot

Problem with "firmware updater" on OSD menu (freeze),
Have to use SAM-BA to update into another firmware https://code.google.com/p/mist-board/wiki/HowToInstallTheFirmware

No more bad border effect found yet.

=TODO=======================================================================
I did use some while(true) on MMC_Read, in order to enter "simulation of user_io" (saying myself that simulation of sdcard could be "not error tolerate" (optimist simulation))
I don't know if poll of MMC_Read architecture does run ok with "simulation of user_io" in case of "return (0);" (an error of crc on MMC_Read)

So I was thinking about another return value of MMC_Read in case of "just timeout", something like "return (2);", cuting "while (true)" using a "break;" in this case. But I didn't implemented that part, that's what I have to do in order to remove the known bug.
