Stereo sound : AB and BC channel in left and right !
Tested with STarKos1_21.dsk sound tracker (see OS6128_BASIC1-1_AMSDOS_MAXAM/STarKos1_21.grimware.txt)

Turned into alpha, because it seems not fully stable, but cool using STarKos1_21...
wolfenstrad succeeded only one time with it.
Seems about TimeConstraints generating some not wanted 1000MHz clocks.
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'FGPAmstrad_MiST_top.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
I need to repair Z80 WAIT_n (for high clocks problems) and write a TimeContraints file (just for low clocks problems) in order to solve that
