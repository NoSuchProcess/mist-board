= Gamepad/Joystick keyboard shortcuts =

Pressing certain button combinations with a USB joystick or gamepad will send specific keyboard keys to a core. This is useful for certain games that require a key press to continue.

Currently we support these mappings:

  * *Buttons 4 + 1:* press Enter key
  * *Buttons 4 + 2:* press Space bar
  * *Buttons 4 + 3:* press F12 (opens OSD in most cores)


= OSD joystick control = 

A USB gamepad or joystick can also be used to control the OSD:

  * *Button 1:* choose / enter menu 
  * *Button 2:* cancel / return to previous menu
  * *Up/Down/Left/Right:* move around menu
  * *Button 3 + Up/Down:* Pageup/Pagedown 

= Disabling shortcuts =

To disable the above joystick mappings, set the following in mist.ini:
