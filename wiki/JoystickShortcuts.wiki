= Gamepad/Joystick keyboard shortcuts =

Through specific button combinations, the MiST can send some keyboard keys to a core. This is useful for some games that require a certain key to progress. 

Currently we support these mappings:

  * *Buttons 4 + 1:* press Enter key
  * *Buttons 4 + 2:* press Space bar
  * *Buttons 4 + 3:* press F12 (opens OSD in most cores)


= OSD joystick control = 

A USB gamepad or joystick can also be used to control the OSD:

  * *Button 1:* choose / enter menu 
  * *Button 1:* cancel / return to previous menu
  * *Up/Down/Left/Right:" move around menu
  * *Button 3 + Up/Down:" PageUp/PageDown
