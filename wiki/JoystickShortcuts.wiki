= Gamepad/Joystick keyboard shortcuts =

Pressing certain button combinations with a USB joystick or gamepad will send specific keyboard keys to a core. This is useful for certain games that require a key press to continue.

This mapping is made from the _virtual gamepad_ [http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/wiki/USBJoystickMapping as defined in this page].

Currently we support these mappings:

  * *START + A:* press Enter key
  * *START + B:* press Space bar
  * *START + SELECT:* press F12 (opens OSD in most cores)


= OSD joystick control = 

A USB controller can also be used to control the OSD:

  * *A:* choose / enter menu 
  * *B:* cancel / return to previous menu
  * *Up/Down/Left/Right:* move around menu
  * *SELECT + Up/Down:* Pageup/Pagedown 
  * *L + Up/Down:* Pageup/Pagedown 
  * *R + Up/Down:* Pageup/Pagedown
