= Introduction =

Welcome to Amstrad core for MiST-board.

This is a deployment of FPGAmstrad into MiST-board.

[CoreDocAmstradNotes Core Developer's Notes]

= Installation =

You need :
  * MiST-board platform, with firmware updated [https://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/browse/trunk/bin/firmware/ >= firmware_150315_r841.upg]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/browse/#svn/trunk/bin/cores/amstrad amstrad core rbf file]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/browse/#svn/trunk/bin/cores/amstrad/OS6128_BASIC1-1_AMSDOS_MAXAM amstrad ROMs and a dsk]



Using the OSD menu (F12), do select a dsk.
You can enter *cat* instruction to list dsk content. Executables are files in *.bas* or *.bin*.
You can then enter *run"file.bas* to run the choosen executable.

= Controls =

 * _F1_ _F2_ _F3_ at the top are mapped correctly.
 * _left_ _shift_ is the true shift key. _Right_ _shift_ one is used just to map flipper key in Macadam Bumper (I like playing flipper using shift keys).
 * _shift+arrow_ does move the second cursor, and _insert_ does copy letters that are under the second cursor. Basically, _insert_ key is mapped to the Amstrad's original _copy_ key.
 * _Page up_ will reset the Amstrad

= Development details / acknowledgments =

This core is a port of FPGAmstrad from code for the NEXYS4 Diligent development board into the MiST board.

FPGAmstrad is a translation of JavaCPC from Java into VHDL (electronic language), essentially *reverse engineering* resulting in an original Amstrad clone.

JavaCPC is an Amstrad CPC 6128 emulator developed by Markus Hohmann.
