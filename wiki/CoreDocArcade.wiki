# documentation for the arcade cores

= Overview =

This page documents how to setup the arcade cores, which currently all share the same handling.


= Installation =

The arcade cores are self-contained in their own {{{*}}}.rbf file, so it is enough to copy them to the SD card. 

As usual, if you'd like the MiST to boot on one, rename it "*core.rbf*" on the root of the SD card.

*Note* these cores do not implement an OSD to switch to another core,
so it is recommended to use a different core for booting, allowing you to select any of the arcade cores.
