= Introduction =

This page has operating instructions for the Amiga core.
(it is a version of minimig)

= Installation =

Copy the minimig FPGA core into a root folder of the SD card. To make the MiST start with this core, rename it to `core.rbf`.

Copy a version of the KickStart ROM into the root folder, renaming it to `kick.rom`. Kickstart 1.2, 1.3 and 3.1 have been tested.

Disk files (HDF, ADF) can be copied anywhere on the SD card, including subfolders.
If you have many files you might want to store them sorted by type (games/apps) and alphabetical folders for finding files easily.
