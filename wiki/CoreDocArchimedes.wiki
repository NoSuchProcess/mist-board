= Introduction =

This page has operating instructions for the Acorn Archimedes core.

*CURRENTLY THIS CORE IS IN BETA STATUS AND LACKS FLOPPY EMULATION*

 # Basic internals are implemented. 
 # No Floppy or hard disk support yet. (if someone has an MMC driver/podule then please mention it in the forums so we can include it inthe core).
 # The core emulates a 4Mb A3000 type machine with an ARM2a with caches disabled for now (has an A3010 style joystick interface). 
 # Core runs pretty slow at the moment due to a memory controller bug.

  * Core binaries (TBA)
  * Source code (TBA)

= Installation =

Copy the Archimedes core into a root folder of the SD card. To make the MiST start with this core, rename it to `core.rbf`.

Copy a version of a RiscOS ROM into the root folder, renaming it to `riscos.rom`. 

----

= OSD Menu =

If the ROM is recognized the core should boot into Risc OS.
Press *Print Screen* to open the OSD menu.

 * OS ROM: choose the RISCOS rom to use
 * Firmware & Core: change MiST core or upgrade firmware
 * Save config: save current config for next boot
 
You can move to other pages of settings by pressing the right arrow key:



== Notes ==

 * For best results it's best to use this as the startup core.
 * If the core does not start try resetting the MiST. 
 * Only RISCOS 3 supports VGA. 
 * Older RISCOS versions will need a VGA to SCART at present (future versions may have a scandoubler).


== License notes ==

This core uses the Amber CPU core from OpenCores which is LGPL. 
The core itself is dual licensed LGPL/BSD.
