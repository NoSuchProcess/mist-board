#summary This pages explains how to compile the firmware

= Prerequisites =

The firmware is written in C. Thus a matching C compiler is needed. The current firmware setup expects a matching version of the gnu compiler collection (GCC) to be installed. 

== Installing GCC on Windows ==

Please refer to this page:

[http://ws0.org/compiling-the-minimig-core-for-the-mist-fpga-board-on-windows/ How to compile the firmware under Windows]

== Installing GCC on Linux ==

Installation is described in [http://retroramblings.net/?p=315 this blog posting]. A [http://mist-board.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/install_arm-none-eabi-gcc.sh shell script] is available to automate the setup.


= Compiling the source code =

The firmware source code is available from the [http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/checkout MIST svn repository].

Once the compiler is installed a simple `make` in the firmware subdirectory will build the latest firmware.


= Installing the firmware =

Three files are generated during compilation:

  * *firmware.bin* is the raw binary of the firmware. This can be uploaded to the MIST board using special flashers
  * *firmware.hex* is the same firmware in intel hex format as required by some uploaders
  * *firmware.upg* is the same firmware in a format suited for self-update via the on-screen-display (OSD)
