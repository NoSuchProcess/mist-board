= List of displays tested with the MiST board =

Since the MiST FPGA cores have a video timing thats closely derived from the 
video timing of the original machines the resulting modes are not 100% VGA
compatible. Different screens cope differently with this. The results range
from completely unusable screens to screens that display nearly everything perfectly.

Especially all PAL modes with a vertical scan rate of 50Hz are exceeding the VGA specification which requires at least 56Hz. Some screens even support a horizontal scan rate of 15khz (TV) modes although this is way below the VGA requirement of 31.5kHz.

Please note in the comment column of single cores/video modes are not supported.

|| *Display* || *size* || *Rating* || *50Hz* || *15kHz* || *Comments* ||
|| Eizo Flexscan L568 || 17" 1280x1024 || 95% || yes || yes || permanent "signal out of range" message on 15kHz modes, works anyway ||
|| Dell 1908FP || 19" 1280x1024 || 90% || yes || no || ||
|| NEC LCD 1525V || 15" 1024x768 || 40% || no || no || ||


= HDMI upscaling options =

Using a video upscaler increases compatibility significantly, as HDMI input is generally good on most displays / TVs.

|| *Device* || *Rating * || *50Hz* || *15kHz* || *Comments* || *Example * ||
|| XRGB-Mini + VGA2SCART converter || 99% || Yes || Yes || 50hz mode gives a pink tint on the C64, MSX, and PCE cores. 15khz mode works great! || [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uN4RDPfnKc video] ||
|| MINI VGA2HDMI || 10% || Yes || No || wobbly image, worse on the C64 core || [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7YPvfFW-gA video] ||
|| VGA+R/L TO HDMI adapter - HD2022 || 10% || Yes || No || same upscaler chip as MINI VGA2HMDI, same issues || [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7YPvfFW-gA video] ||
