= List of displays tested with the MiST board =

Since the MiST FPGA cores have a video timing thats closely derived from the 
video timing of the original machines the resulting modes are not 100% VGA
compatible. Different screens cope differently with this. The results range
from completely unusable screens to screens that display nearly everything perfectly.

Especially all PAL modes with a vertical scan rate of 50Hz are exceeding the VGA specification which requires at least 56Hz. Some screens even support a horizontal scan rate of 15khz (TV) modes although this is way below the VGA requirement of 31.5kHz.

Please note in the comment column of single cores/video modes are not supported.

|| Eizo Flexscan L568 || 17" 1280x1024 || 95% || yes || yes || permanent "signal out of range" message on 15kHz modes, works anyway ||
|| Dell 1908FP || 19" 1280x1024 || 90% || yes || no || ||
|| NEC LCD 1525V || 15" 1024x768 || 40% || no || no || ||

= Upscaling options =

Using a video upscaler increases compatibility.
