= Installation =

Copy the {{{*}}}.rbf file at the root of the SD card.
You can rename the file to core.rbf if you want the MiST to load it automatically at startup.

Disk images can be copied anywhere on the SD card and are selected via the OSD menu. They must be in NIB format to work (instead of e.g. DSK).
If you have many files you might want to store them into alphabetized sub-folders to access them more quickly.
