= Introduction =

This page has operating instructions for the ZX Spectrum core.

= Links =

 * [http://www.mike-stirling.com/retro-fpga/zx-spectrum-on-an-fpga/ ZX Spectrum on FPGA homepage]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/browse/trunk/bin/cores/spectrum Core binaries]
 * [http://ramsoft.bbk.org.omegahg.com/csw.html#CSW1FORMAT Info on the CSW1 file format]

= Installation =

Copy the {{{*}}}.rbf file at the root of the SD card.
You can rename the file to core.rbf if you want the MiST to load it automatically at startup.

Roms (.csw) can be copied anywhere on the SD card and are selected via the OSD menu.
If you have many files you might want to store them into alphabetized sub-folders to access them more quickly.

== Converting CSW1 files ==
 
 * The [https://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftools%2Ftzx2wav TZX2WAV utility] can convert TZX files into CSW.
 * To convert TAP filtes intO TZW you might need to use older utilities.

Some older utilities no longer work in the latest verison of Windows, but you can use Dosbox to run them.

= OSD Menu =

The second page contains some general options:
  * *Firmware & core *: allows to switch to another core or upgrade the MiST firmware
  * *Save settings*: save the current settins to the SD card for next startup

In the rom selection screen, you can select a CSW with Enter.

== Notes ==
