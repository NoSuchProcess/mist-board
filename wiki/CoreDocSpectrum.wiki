= Introduction =

This page has operating instructions for the ZX Spectrum core.

= Installation =

Copy the {{{*}}}.rbf file at the root of the SD card.
You can rename the file to core.rbf if you want the MiST to load it automatically at startup.

ROMs (.csw) can be copied anywhere on the SD card and are selected via the OSD menu.
If you have many files you might want to store them into alphabetized sub-folders to access them more quickly.

== Using DIVMMC/ESXDOS ==

The DIVMMC/[http://www.esxdos.org/ ESXDOS] combo provides easy and fast access to spectrum games stored on SD card. With release r877 the zxmmc has been replaced by a DIVMMC implementation in the spectrum core.

In order to enable the DIVMMC on your MiST simply put the file `ESCMMC.BIN` from the [http://www.esxdos.org/files/esxdos085.zip `esxdos085.zip`] onto the SD card naming it `spectrum.rom`. Follow the instructions in that archive and also copy the entire `BIN` and `SYS` directories onto your SD card and boot your MIST with that.

On first boot the SD card will be detected. You can open the ESXDOS menu at any time using either the NMI entry from the MiST OSD. Or by pressing the fourth button on your USB gamepad (of course only if the gamepad has at least four buttons).

Since some of the data is kept in RAM for several seconds you might need to switch of the MIST for about 10 seconds if you wish to force a cold boot and complete reload of the ESXDOS drivers.

== Converting CSW1 files ==
 
 * The [https://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftools%2Ftzx2wav TZX2WAV utility] can convert TZX files into CSW.
 * To convert TAP files into TZW you might need to use older utilities.

Some older utilities no longer work in the latest version of Windows, but you can use Dosbox to run them.

= OSD Menu =

The core will start with a blank screen. Press F12 to enter the OSD menu:

  * *Load {{{*}}}.CSW*: load a CSW tape image from the SD card
  * *Reset*: restart the ZX spectrum core

The second page contains some general options:
  * *Firmware & core *: allows to switch to another core or upgrade the MiST firmware
  * *Save settings*: save the current settings to the SD card for next startup

In the rom selection screen, you can select a CSW with Enter.

== Notes ==

  * Video mode is 720x572p at 50hz.
