= Introduction =

= Links =

  * [http://retroramblings.net/?page_id=965  Core binary releases]

= Installation =

At the moment, this core only supports reading files from the SD root. 
It is thus recommended to use it on its own SD card to make it easier to select rom files.

Copy the {{{*}}}.rbf file at the root of the SD card.
You can rename the file to core.rbf if you want the MiST to load it automatically at startup.

Copy PCE roms in the same root folder.
