= Installation =

After following the binary link above, go into the latest folder and find `atari5200.rbf` located under `/mist_5200/build_NTSC_VGA/out/` .
Copy the file to the root of an SD card, and if you will only use the SD card for this core, then also rename the file to `core.rbf`.


Create the following sub-folders in the SD card (note the missing i):
 * `/atar5200/`
 * `/atar5200/rom/`
 * `/atar5200/user/`

Copy an image of the Atari5200 ROM into the `/atar5200/rom/` folder, renaming it to *5200.rom* so the core will find it.

Copy games into the `/atar5200/user/` folder.
