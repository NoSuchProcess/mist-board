= Introduction =

This page has operating instructions for the Atari 5200 core.

= Links =
  * [http://www.scrameta.net/autobuild/ Core binaries]
  
= Installation =

After following the binary link above, go into the latest folder and find `atari5200.rbf` located under `/mist_5200/build_NTSC_VGA/out/` .
Copy the file to the root of an SD card, and if you will only use the SD card for this core, then also rename the file to `core.rbf`.


Create the following sub-folders in the SD card (note the missing i):
 * `/atar5200/`
 * `/atar5200/rom/`
 * `/atar5200/user/`

Copy an image of the Atari5200 ROM into the `/atar5200/rom/` folder, renaming it to *5200.rom* so the core will find it.

Copy games into the `/atar5200/user/` folder.

= Controls =

 * F1: Start
 * F2: Pause
 * F3: Reset
 * F10: Cold reset
 * F11: Load new ROM
 * F12: Enter OSD menu

For paddle games, a USB analog joystick is required.
(or real A5200 controllers via USB adapter)

For the number pad, use these keys (US layout):

||F1||F2||F3||
||1||2||3||   
||Q||W||E||  
||A||S||D||  
||Z||X||C||  

The above corresponds to this in the Atari pad:

||Start||Pause||Reset||
||1||2||3|| 
||3||4||5||
||6||7||8||
||`*`||0||#||

= OSD Menu =

On startup you will see an Atari logo with no ROM loaded:

<img title="Atari 5200 start" src="http://mist-board.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img_docs/a5200_start.jpg" width="320px" />

Press F12 to enter the OSD Menu.

<img title="Atari5200 menu" src="http://mist-board.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img_docs/a5200_settings.jpg" width="320px" />

In this menu you need to move around with the keyboard arrow keys, and select with Enter.

 * *Turbo*: accelerate the core (default is 1X)
 * *Ram*: Avaiable RAM, stays at 16K
 * *Rom*: Name of the ROM being used. 
 * *Cart*: Choose a cart to load from `/atar5200/user/`
 
It is possible to change the Rom path through this menu, but not necessary.

You can press F11 instead of F12 to directly go into the *Cart* option. 

When selecting a cart, the core may not recognize the cart type so it may ask you to choose what cart type to load.

If you don't know which type it is, select one and see if the game loads.
If not, press F12 then load the ROM again as the other cart type.

If the ROM loads, you can start the game with F1.
