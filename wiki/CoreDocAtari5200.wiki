After following the binary link above, go into the latest folder and find the *atari5200.rbf* file located under `/mist_5200/build_NTSC_VGA/out/` .

Copy the file to the root of an SD card, optionally renaming it to `core.rbf` if you want the MiST to load it on startup.


Create the following sub-folders in the SD card (note the missing i):
 * `/atar5200/`
 * `/atar5200/rom/`
 * `/atar5200/user/`

Copy an image of the Atari5200 ROM into the `/atar5200/rom/` folder, then rename it to *5200.rom*.

Copy games into the `/atar5200/user/` folder.
