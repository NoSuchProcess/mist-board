= Using mist.ini =

The MiST firmware has a few configuration options available, which can be set by adding  a "mist.ini" file to the root of the SD card.

Overall the file should contain a "mist" tag at the top:

{{{
[mist]
scandoubler_disable=0
mouse_boot_mode=0
}}}

Comments can be added after each setting by using ; e.g.:

{{{
[mist]
scandoubler_disable=0 ; leave at 0 if not sure
mouse_boot_mode=0     ; leave at 0 if not sure
}}}
= Description =

== scandoubler_disable ==

If set to 1, some cores will disable their scandoubler to produce a 15khz video signal. This works better for upscalers and arcade displays.

Support is core specific; currently it is only used by the ST and Amiga cores. All other cores will ignore the setting.


== mouse_boot_mode ==

Set to 1 to revert back to an old mouse handler which may solve compatibility issues with some mice (the default handler is much more compatible with keyboard/mouse wireless devices, though).
