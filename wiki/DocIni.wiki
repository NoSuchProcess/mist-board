= Using mist.ini =

The MiST firmware has a few configuration options available.

Overall the file should contain a "mist" tag at the top and have at least one blank line at the bottom:

{{{
[mist]
scandoubler_disable=0
<eof>
}}}

= Options =

== scandoubler_disable ==

If set to 1, some cores will disable their scandoubler to produce a 15khz video signal. This works better for upscalers and arcade displays.

Support is core specific though, currently it is only used by the ST and Amiga cores.
