This is a fork of MiST firmware, to be merged with trunk one.
mmc.h/c :
* CRC16_buf : crc16 algorithm
* MMC_Init with CRC16 mode activated
* crc16 check on MMC_Read
user_io.h/c :
* while loop on user_io
spi.h/c :
* spi_block_write with 514 of data instead of 512 (512+crc16)

Gain robustness in dsk changes.
